This folder is where datasets downloaded through the `torch-geometric` and `dgl` libraries will be stored. It is currently empty, but once you run the example code from the `README.md` file, it will automatically create a 'data' subfolder to hold the datasets.

## Environmental details
torch-geometric == 2.6.0
dgl == 1.1.0
